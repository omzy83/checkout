# checkout

The purpose of this repository is to give you an idea of my e-commerce knowledge.

It contains an extract of some checkout functionality from an e-commerce website that I built in Laravel.

It features the ability to set up direct debit (recurring) payments or standalone payments.

The transactions are processed via an external API that communicates over SOAP requests.
